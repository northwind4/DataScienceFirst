My first work at a real dataset. 
I used the file in input folder.
I wrote the kernel with Python. I included Numpy, Matplotlib.pyplot and Pandas libraries.
There are three plot figures at output. They are 'Line Plot', 'Scatter Plot' and 'Histogram Plot'.
Additionally there are two filters I had executed on the dataset.
